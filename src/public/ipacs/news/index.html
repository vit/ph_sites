        It was a success with 190 registered participants. 46 participants came from outside of Russia, including 9 from Japan, 6 from Germany, 3 from China, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, 2 from France. 212 talks (6 plenary, 3 invited and 70 poster) representing 35 countries were included into the preliminary program. 184 papers are included into the CD-ROM Proceedings and will be published in the IEEExplore Electronic Library.
It was decided to organize the next "Physics and Control" Conference in 2007, probably in Potsdam, Germany.
After the closing ceremony   the foundation meeting of the International Physics And Control Society (IPACS) took place. At the meeting the IPACS Regulations have been approved and the new International Society has been established. The <a href="http://physcon.ru">Physics and Control Resources portal</a> will now be conducted by the IPACS Board. More information will be available soon.

        In August 2003, the <a href="http://conf.physcon.ru/2003">1st International Conference "Physics and Control"</a> was held in St.Petersburg, Russia. The conference was a success with about 250 participants from 33 countries and demonstrated existence of a broad scientific community at the borderland between Physics and Control and a strong need to enhance information exchange among its members.
To promote such an exchange the information portal "Physics and Control Resources" (PHYSCON) has been  launched.
Visitors will find at PHYSCON information about centers and  groups, events, education and information websites, organizations and  funds, publications, news - everything  related to Physics and Control worldwide.
We invite you,  your friends and colleagues to visit PHYSCON at <a href="http://physcon.ru">http://physcon.ru</a>
Send your comments and/or suggestions as well as additional information and links for inclusion into PHYSCON to <a href="mailto:info@physcon.ru">info@physcon.ru</a>
