<p class = paratitle align="center"><b>Dear Colleagues and Guests,</b> </p>


<p>
It is our honor and pleasure to invite you to participate in the
 International  Conference  "Physics and Control" (PhysCon 2003)
to be held on August 20-22, 2003 in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

<p>
 The Conference "Physics and Control" will be the first international conference
 focusing on the borderland between Physics and Control  fields with emphasis 
on both theory and applications.
<br>
   A major goal of the Conference is to bring together researchers from 
different scientific communities  and to gain some general and unified 
perspectives in the studying of controlled systems in physics, chemistry, 
biology and other natural sciences. We hope that the Conference will help experts 
in control theory to get acquainted with new interesting problems, and help experts 
in physics and related fields to know more about tools of the modern control theory.

<p>
It turned that PhysCon 2003 has attracted a large interest of different scientific
 communities. More than 330 papers were submitted from 35 countries, and almost 300
are included into the preliminary program. 12 invited sessions have been organized.

<p>
We will do our best to create a friendly atmosphere for work and rest, encourage new 
personal contacts and exchange of ideas.  The year 2003 has a special meaning for  
Saint Petersburg: the 300th Anniversary of the city will be celebrated in May. 
The events dedicated to the Anniversary will take place during the whole year 
and a lot of tourists and guests are expected. We wish the participants 
to enjoy the historical sites and the amenities of this city, 
including the masterpieces of the Hermitage and the Russian Museum, 
the Royal palaces, charming suburbs, picturesque islands and embankments. 
Make your plans to stay over the weekend to attend various sightseeing tours
<br>
<br>
    The Symposium will be held in the beautiful <a href=anichkov.html target=_blank>
"Anichkov Palace"</a>, located in the historical part of the city,  one of the 
residences of the Tsars' family in several generations.<br>

<p>
   Looking  forward to meeting you in Saint Petersburg in August 2003.<br>
        </ffont></p>
