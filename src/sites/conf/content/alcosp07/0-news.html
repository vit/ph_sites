<p>
Two IFAC events  organized in Saint Petersburg in Anichkov Palace: ALCOSP 2007 and PSYCO 2007 are now part of history. Both events were a success with 125 registered participants from 22 countries, including 40 from Russia, 22 from Japan, 12 from France, 9 from Chech Republic, 8 from USA. The technical program included 136 regular talks  (90 in ALCOSP'07 and 46 in PSYCO'07), 10 plenary talks and 22 posters. Details, including technical program see at
the websites
of ALCOSP'07 <a href="http://conf.physcon.ru/alcosp07/">http://conf.physcon.ru/alcosp07/</a>
and  PSYCO 2007: <a href="http://conf.physcon.ru/psyco07/">http://conf.physcon.ru/psyco07/</a>.

<p>
Among highlights of technical program  there were plenary talks of top experts in the area of systems and control: B.D.O. Anderson (Australia), F.L.Chernousko (Russia), M.Krstic (USA), A.Shiriaev (Sweden, Norway), V.A.Bondarko and V.A.Yakubovich (Russia), M.Tomizuka (USA), A.Astolfi (UK), I.I.Blekhman (Russia), A.B.Kurzhanski (Russia), P.R.Kumar (USA).

<p>
There were four invited sessions at ALCOSP'07:
<ul>
<li>Modelling technique for adaptive control design (Organizer S. Masuda, Japan);</li>
<li>Passification-based Adaptive and Robust Control (Organizers D. Peaucelle (France), A. L. Fradkov (Russia);</li>
<li>Simple Adaptive Control (Organizers I. Barkana (USA), A. L. Fradkov (Russia);</li>
<li>Neural Networks (Organizer O. A. Stepanov, Russia)</li>
</ul>
and two invited sessions at PSYCO'07:
<ul>
<li>Discrete and Hybrid Control systems (Organizers  G. Leonov (Russia), H. Nijmeijer (The Netherlands);</li>
<li>Computational methods and Software Tools for periodic systems (Organizer  A. Varga, Germany)</li>
</ul>

<p>
An interesting panel discussion devoted to strengthening links with industry was organized before the closing ceremony. Invited panelists were chosen among participants of the Workshops affiliated with industrial companies:
<br>
Dr. Itzhak Barkana (Kulicke & Soffa Industries, Inc., USA),  Dr.Yevgeny Somov (State Research & Production Rocket-Space Center TsSKB-Progress, FKA, Russia), Dr. Oleg Stepanov (CS&RI Elektropribor, Russia). The discussion was moderated by Dr. Martin Gitsels, the Head of "Corporate Technologies" Department at Siemens, Russia. Opening discussion, Dr. Gitsels said that in order to gain interaction of theorists and industry people it is important to bear in mind that industry is interested in solution of concrete practical problems rather than in general theory. Success of cooperation depends essentially on mutual understanding of partners. Panelists agreed that further development of general theoretic 
approaches is out of interest for industry. They also pointed out that there is strong demand for good textbooks for engineers, written in simple and clear language; and that the universities should produce specialists with a broad view and unprejudiced attitude to practical problems. Participants commented on importance of steps made by the industry to the universities to meet their needs. An interesting comment was made by Prof. K. Furuta (Japan) who said that young people get interested in practical problems when they can see some challenge of even crisis coming from industry - some problems cannot be solved by existing approaches. If  no such challenges are observed, we need to create them in order to maintain mutual interest of  industry and universities.

<p>
After the Workshops the Organizers got more than 40 letters of gratitude from participants. The Organizers are grateful as well to all attendees for their coming.

<p>
See you again in St.Petersburg!
