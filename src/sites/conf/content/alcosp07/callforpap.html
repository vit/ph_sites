<p>
<b>SCOPE:</b>
<br>
A major goal of the Workshop is to bring together researchers and educators
and to gain some general and unified perspectives in the studying of adaptive,
learning and intelligent systems. The scope of the workshop will cover all areas
of adaptive systems theory and its applications in science and engineering, 
in particular in control, communications and signal processing. 
The topics for the Workshop ALCOSP 2007 include but are not limited to: 
<ul>
<li>Adaptive control of linear or nonlinear systems</li>
<li>Stochastic adaptive control</li>
<li>Learning and intelligent control</li>
<li>Stability and complex dynamics</li>
<li>Adaptive and intelligent networked systems</li>
<li>Adaptation and learning in telecommunications</li>
<li>Identification</li>
<li>Gain-scheduling</li>
<li>Recursive algorithms</li>
<li>Adaptive filters</li>
<li>Adaptive signal processing</li>
<li>Adaptation and learning applications (motion control, communications,
nano- and femto-technologies, etc.)</li>
</ul>
Panel discussion on topics of interest to industry is to be organized. 
Industrial companies are invited to participate in product exhibition 
(please contact the organizers).


<p>

<b>WORKING LANGUAGE:</b>
<br>
English will be the official language of the Workshop.
No simultaneous translation will be provided.

<p>
<b>SOCIAL PROGRAM:</b>
<br>
Saint Petersburg (the former capital of Russia) with about 5 millions
inhabitants is often called "The Venice of the North" and recognized
as one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Various guided tours
over St. Petersburg and sub-urbs including visits to Tsars' palaces 
and museums will be organized during both the Workshop days and the weekends. 

<p>
<b>LOCATION AND CONFERENCE VENUE:</b>
<br>
St.Petersburg is located in the mouth of Neva river near the Finnish
Gulf of the Baltic Sea. There are daily flights of major international
carriers to the International airport "Pulkovo" of St.Petersburg.
It also can be reached from Helsinki, Finland by plane (0.5 hours)
or by train (4 hours).

<p>
The Workshop will take place in the Imperial Anichkov Palace - 
one of the residences of the Tsars' family in several generations, 
beautifully located in the historical center of the city. 
Some pictures of the Anichkov Palace can be found on the Workshop
