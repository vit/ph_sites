New IFAC publication policy (excerpts from the recent letters for IFAC events organizers)
</p>

<p>
IFAC is pleased to announce that, in co-operation with Elsevier, the IFAC Publisher, all IFAC technical meeting
papers (where IFAC is the principal sponsor) will, in the future, be published online on a dedicated website. The
name for this site is IFAC-PapersOnLine.net.
<br>
Online publication is now regarded as the norm in the scientific community.  IFAC is developing the IFAC-PapersOnLine.net site as an on-line archive with FREE ACCESS BY ALL USERS TO ALL PAPERS.
<br>
The IFAC-PapersOnLine.net website will have the following main features:
<ul>
<li>
Papers from IFAC Symposia, Congresses, Conferences, and Workshops (at the discretion of
the Workshop organizers) will be available with no charge for reading or downloading for personal use,
up to a maximum of 50 downloads per month. All papers actually presented at the meeting will be published
on the site in PDF format - searchable and citable using the existing IFAC Proceedings ISSN and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) - the latest industry standard for citing digital publications.
</li>
<li>
Printed volumes will no longer be available from the IFAC Publisher, although organizers will be free to produce their papers in any form they wish and sell them if they choose to do so.
</li>
<li>
The IFAC-PapersOnLine.net site should be ready for a demonstration at the time of the IFAC Symposium on Aerospace Control Applications ACA 2007 (Toulouse, June 28-30, 2007) during the IFAC Council and related meetings. It is expected that it will include at least all papers presented at IFAC technical meetings
held in 2005 and 2006 and by the end of 2007 will include all 2007 meetings. Efforts will be made to upload all papers from IFAC meetings prior to 2005 that are already in electronic format.
</li>
<li>
User manuals will be produced for organizers and authors and are expected to be ready by June 2007. Preparation details will be very similar to those currently used by IFAC.
</li>
<li>
IFAC policy requires that all papers actually presented at the meeting will appear on the site shortly after the meeting at the latest. Copyright of all papers will belong to IFAC and must be referenced if derivative journal papers are produced from the conference papers.
</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
ALCOSP'07 and PSYCO'07 Organizers are in contact with the team of the IFAC-PapersOnLine project.
<br>
Further information for ALCOSP'07 and PSYCO'07 authors will be available on this website and in the notification letters to be distributed by April, 25.
