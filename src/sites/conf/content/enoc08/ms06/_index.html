title="Mini-Symposium on Resonant problems in slow-fast systems"
+++


<p>
This mini-symposium provides a forum for discussing
resonant phenomena in slow-fast systems.
Those are systems which contain dynamical variables of two
types: slow and fast ones. Particular
case is the system with slowly varying parameters.
Interaction of resonances and other singularities
in dynamics of fast variables and drift of slow variables
lead to interesting and important 
phenomena such as capture into resonance, creating big
domains of chaotic dynamics, destruction
of adiabatic invariance etc. Papers are solicited that deal
with analytic, numeric or experimental
analysis of resonant and other interesting phenomena in
dynamics of slow-fast systems.

<p>
Full text draft papers (4–6 two-column pages) should be submitted by <b>November 15, 2007</b> to the Organizing Committee. All contri­butions will be subject to reviewing. No more than two papers for each presenting author will be accepted.
</p>

<p>
The title should be followed by the authors' names, affiliations, addresses (including FAX and E-mail address) and abstracts (60–100 words). Electronic submission in PDF or PS format is preferable. The site for electronic submission will be launched in <b>September, 2007</b>. Accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings, which will appear on CD-ROM and will be available for conference participants on the website after the meeting.
