title="Mini-Symposium on Asymptotic Methods"
+++


<p>
The aim of the mini-symposium is to gather specialists working on various and important applications of asymptotic methods to nonlinear dynamics. The mini-symposium is expected to cover the following topics: asymptotic investigation of vibrations in lumped and continuous systems, boundary layer problems, singular asymptotic, homogenization, asymptotic techniques to analyze localized oscillations and waves, long-wave and short-wave asymptotic approaches to lumped mechanical systems, asymptotical methods to study nonlinear resonances, modern asymptotic methods, small and large as well as natural and artificial parameters, etc.
</p>

<p>
In addition, an emphasis will be put on solving of initial and boundary value problems, derivation of effective models of media with a microstructure by using multiple scaling, perturbation methods in the computer age, and modern perturbation methods in engineering and pure sciences.
</p>

<p>
Full text draft papers (4–6 two-column pages) should be submitted by <b>November 15, 2007</b> to the Organizing Committee. All contri­butions will be subject to reviewing. No more than two papers for each presenting author will be accepted.
</p>

<p>
The title should be followed by the authors' names, affiliations, addresses (including FAX and E-mail address) and abstracts (60–100 words). Electronic submission in PDF or PS format is preferable. The site for electronic submission will be launched in <b>September, 2007</b>. Accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings, which will appear on CD-ROM and will be available for conference participants on the website after the meeting.
