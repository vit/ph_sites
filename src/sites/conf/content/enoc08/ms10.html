<h2 align=center>Mini-Symposium on Nonlinear Vibrations and Applications</h2>

<p>
This mini-symposium provides a forum for presenting and discussing applications of nonlinear vibrations and nonlinear analysis for specific real-life purposes. Papers are solicited that deal with purposely utilizing or avoiding nonlinear vibrations / oscillations, primarily within mechanical engineering, but also in electrical / chemical / civil engineering, medicine, physics, biology, economics, social sciences, optics, climate and geophysics, and other sciences. Theoretical, experimental, and numerical works are welcomed. The prime criterion for acceptance of a paper is whether it demonstrates a relevant, interesting, promising, or inspiring application of nonlinear vibrations or nonlinear analysis for achieving benefits in real life.
</p>

<p>
Full text draft papers (4–6 two-column pages) should be submitted by <b>November 15, 2007</b> to the Organizing Committee. All contri­butions will be subject to reviewing. No more than two papers for each presenting author will be accepted.
</p>

<p>
The title should be followed by the authors' names, affiliations, addresses (including FAX and E-mail address) and abstracts (60–100 words). Electronic submission in PDF or PS format is preferable. The site for electronic submission will be launched in <b>September, 2007</b>. Accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings, which will appear on CD-ROM and will be available for conference participants on the website after the meeting.
</p>

<p>
