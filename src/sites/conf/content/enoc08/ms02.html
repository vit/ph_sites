<h2 align=center>Mini-Symposium on Dynamics and Optimization of Multibody Systems</h2>

<p>
Papers are solicited in the general area of multibody system dynamics. Topics include component modelling, equation formulation, numerical simulation, and validation of results. Of interest are papers related to mechatronic devices or vehicles and other multidisciplinary (multi-physics) applications, biomechanics and biomechatronics, symbolic formulations and validation, robotics, real-time and hardware-in-loop simulation, impact and friction models, computational methods for kinematics and dynamics, multidisciplinary optimization (MD0), virtual reality applications, nonlinear dynamics and control, parameter identification, and experimental procedures.
</p>

<p>
Full text draft papers (4–6 two-column pages) should be submitted by <b>November 15, 2007</b> to the Organizing Committee. All contri­butions will be subject to reviewing. No more than two papers for each presenting author will be accepted.
</p>

<p>
The title should be followed by the authors' names, affiliations, addresses (including FAX and E-mail address) and abstracts (60–100 words). Electronic submission in PDF or PS format is preferable. The site for electronic submission will be launched in <b>September, 2007</b>. Accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings, which will appear on CD-ROM and will be available for conference participants on the website after the meeting.
</p>
