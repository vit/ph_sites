<h3 align=center>SCOPE  OF  THE  CONFERENCE</h3>

<p>
Although still the brand name ENOC (EUROMECH Nonlinear Oscillations  Conference) is used as the historical abbreviation, the ENOC Conferences aim at covering the complete field of Nonlinear Dynamics, including Multibody Dynamics and couplings to related fields like Control and (Structural) Optimization. 
</p>

<p>
During the past decades, the area of Nonlinear Dynamics has been evolved in a revolutionary way, in particular in conjunction to applications in nonlinear engineering systems. The application of Nonlinear Dynamics to a wide variety of engineering systems has been possible due to the use of sophisticated computational techniques employing powerful concepts of Nonlinear Dynamics. These concepts have been and are being developed in Control, Mathematics, Mechanics and Physics. Careful experimental studies are vitally needed to observe and establish the real dynamical phenomena. 
</p>

<p>
The ENOC 2008 Conference is aimed at bringing together a wide variety of specialists in the above fields with the purpose to show the latest developments in the respective fields, to exchange experience and to stimulate further interaction. 
</p>

<p>
The topics for the Conference ENOC 2008 include but are not limited to:
</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Nonlinear dynamics of continuous, discontinuous  and hybrid systems.</li>
<li>Qualitative and quantitative analysis of nonlinear dynamic systems.</li>
<li>Analysis of bifurcations and chaos.</li>
<li>Numerical and geometrical methods in nonlinear dynamics.</li>
<li>Phenomena and criteria of chaotic oscillations.</li>
<li>Computer aided symbolic methods in dynamics.</li>
<li>Control of oscillations and chaos.</li>
<li>Experimental methods in nonlinear dynamics.</li>
<li>Applications in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, physics, biology, chemistry and other sciences.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Contributions may be assigned either to Lecture Sessions or to Poster Discussion Sessions.
<br>
Proposals on organizing invited sessions and panel discussions on “hot topics” are welcome.
</p>


<h3 align=center>SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS</h3>

<p>
Full text draft papers (4–6 two-column pages) should be submitted by November 15, 2007 to the Organizing Committee. All contri­butions will be subject to reviewing.. No more than two papers for each presenting author will be accepted.
</p>

<p>
The title should be followed by the authors' names, affiliations, addresses (including FAX and E-mail address) and abstracts (60–100 words). Electronic submission in PDF or PS format is preferable. The site for electronic submission will be launched in September, 2007. Accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings, which will appear on CD-ROM and will be available for conference participants on the website after the meeting.
</p>


<h3 align=center>LOCATION</h3>

<p>
Saint Petersburg is located in the mouth of Neva river near the Finnish Gulf of the Baltic Sea. There are daily flights of major international carriers to the International airport "Pulkovo" of St. Petersburg. It also can be reached from Helsinki, Finland by plane (0.5 hours) or by train (4 hours).
</p>

<!-- h3 align=center>CONFERENCE VENUE</h3>

<p>
It is planned that the Conference will take place in the Imperial Anichkov Palace – one of the residences of the Tsars’ family in several generations, beautifully located in the historical center of the city. Some pictures of the Anichkov Palace can be found on the Conference website.
</p -->

<h3 align=center>SOCIAL PROGRAM</h3>

<p>
Saint Petersburg (the former capital of Russia) with about 5 millions inhabitants is often called “The Venice of the North” and recognized as one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Various guided tours over St. Petersburg and sub­urbs including visits to Tsars’ palaces and museums will be organized during both the Conference days and the weekends.
