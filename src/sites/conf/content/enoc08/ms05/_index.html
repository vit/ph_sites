title="Mini-Symposium on Nonlinear Dynamics and Characterization of Distributed-Parameter Systems"
+++


<p>
Papers are solicited in all areas related to theoretical, computational and experimental aspects of dynamics, vibration, identification, control and optimization of structures with nonlinearities and multi-body systems.
</p>

<p>
Appropriate topics relevant to the symposium include the following: dynamic modeling and vibration of structural elements involving clearances, impacts and friction; dynamics of microscale systems; stability and bifurcation analysis of piecewise linear systems and structures, dynamic response of hysteretic systems; vibration absorbers; rotordynamics of systems with bearing clearances and gear backlash; system identification methods and applications; damage identification methods; active and passive structural damping; smart structures; applications of smart sensors and actuators; optimal sensor and actuator location methods; multi-objective optimization.
</p>

<p>
Full text draft papers (4–6 two-column pages) should be submitted by <b>November 15, 2007</b> to the Organizing Committee. All contri­butions will be subject to reviewing. No more than two papers for each presenting author will be accepted.
</p>

<p>
The title should be followed by the authors' names, affiliations, addresses (including FAX and E-mail address) and abstracts (60–100 words). Electronic submission in PDF or PS format is preferable. The site for electronic submission will be launched in <b>September, 2007</b>. Accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings, which will appear on CD-ROM and will be available for conference participants on the website after the meeting.
