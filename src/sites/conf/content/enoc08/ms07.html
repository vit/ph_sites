<h2 align=center>Mini-Symposium on Fractional Derivatives and Their Applications</h2>

<p>
Papers are solicited in the area of fractional derivatives and their applications. The subject of the papers includes, but is not limited to, mathematical modeling of fractional dynamic systems, analytical and numerical techniques to solve these equations, fractional model of viscoelastic damping, large scale finite element models of fractional systems and associated numerical scheme, fractional controller design and system identification, stability analysis of fractional systems, nonlinear and stochastic fractional dynamic systems, fractional models and their experimental verifications, and applications of fractional models to engineering systems.
</p>

<p>
Full text draft papers (4–6 two-column pages) should be submitted by <b>November 15, 2007</b> to the Organizing Committee. All contri­butions will be subject to reviewing. No more than two papers for each presenting author will be accepted.
</p>

<p>
The title should be followed by the authors' names, affiliations, addresses (including FAX and E-mail address) and abstracts (60–100 words). Electronic submission in PDF or PS format is preferable. The site for electronic submission will be launched in <b>September, 2007</b>. Accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings, which will appear on CD-ROM and will be available for conference participants on the website after the meeting.
