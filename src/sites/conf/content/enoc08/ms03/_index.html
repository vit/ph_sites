title="Mini-Symposium on Micro- and Nano- Electro-Mechanical Systems"
+++


<p>
Papers are solicited in the general area of nonlinear dynamics of micro- and nano- electro-mechanical systems. Topics include modeling, analysis and experimental results related to the nonlinear dynamic behavior of MEMS and NEMS devices. Of interest are papers related to the constructive use of nonlinearities in these devices, for example, the development of nonlinear filters, control schemes, and the analysis of the global bifurcations related to 'pull in' and 'jump-to-contact' instabilities, as well as the general characterization of nonlinear behavior, for example the identification of nonlinear system parameters, modeling of dissipation mechanisms, and the influence of noise or thermal effects on nonlinear system response.

<p>
Full text draft papers (4–6 two-column pages) should be submitted by <b>November 15, 2007</b> to the Organizing Committee. All contri­butions will be subject to reviewing. No more than two papers for each presenting author will be accepted.
</p>

<p>
The title should be followed by the authors' names, affiliations, addresses (including FAX and E-mail address) and abstracts (60–100 words). Electronic submission in PDF or PS format is preferable. The site for electronic submission will be launched in <b>September, 2007</b>. Accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings, which will appear on CD-ROM and will be available for conference participants on the website after the meeting.
