<p class = paratitle align="center"><b>Dear Colleagues and Guests,</b> </p>


<p>
It is my honor and pleasure to invite you to participate in the 6th European Nonlinear Dynamics Conference (ENOC 2008) to be held on June 30 – July 4, 2008 in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
</p>

<p>
During the past decades, the area of Nonlinear Dynamics has been evolved in a revolutionary way. The application of Nonlinear Dynamics to a wide variety of engineering systems has been possible due to the use of sophisticated computational techniques employing powerful concepts of Nonlinear Dynamics. These concepts have been and are being developed in Control, Mathematics, Mechanics and Physics. Careful experimental studies are vitally needed to observe and establish the real dynamical phenomena.
</p>

<p>
The ENOC 2008 Conference is aimed at bringing together a wide variety of specialists in the above fields with the purpose to show the latest developments in the respective fields, to exchange experience and to stimulate further interaction.
</p>

<p>
The organizers will do their best to create a friendly atmosphere for work and rest, encourage new personal contacts and exchange of ideas. I wish the participants to enjoy the historical sites and the amenities of this city, including the masterpieces of the Hermitage and the Russian Museum, the Royal palaces, charming suburbs, picturesque islands and embankments. Make your plans to stay over the weekends to attend various sightseeing tours.
</p>

<p>
The Conference Opening and Closing ceremonies as well as the plenary sessions will be held in the Saint-Petersburg Hotel, conveniently located close to the center of the city. The oral and poster sessions will be held in the premises of the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics of the Saint Petersburg State University at Vasilievsky Island, located within a walking distance from the metro (subway) station “Vasileostrovskaya”.
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to meeting you in Saint Petersburg in summer, 2008
</p>
