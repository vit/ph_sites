<h2 align=center>Mini-Symposium on Reduced-Order Modeling</h2>

<p>
Papers are solicited on reduced-order modeling, with the aim of gaining insight into complex dynamical behavior, or of performing effective and robust system identification / modal analysis of linear or nonlinear dynamical systems. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, order reduction of spatially extended lightweight systems with high modal densities; non proportionally damped systems with mechanical joints; systems with local nonlinearities; use of  linear  or nonlinear techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition,  center manifolds, nonlinear Galerkin methods, normal forms or nonlinear normal modes for order reduction of systems described by ordinary or partial differential equations; and integration of reduced order modelling into prognostic/diagnostic tools for fault detection in vibrating systems. Analytical, numerical and/or experimental methods describing new approaches for effective and robust order reduction are especially welcome.

<!-- p>
Abstracts should be submitted before 15 November 2007. The maximum length of each abstract is limited to two pages with up to four references. All Abstracts submitted will be reviewed for presentation at the ENOC-2008. All Abstracts of papers accepted for presentation will be printed in the Abstract Book.
</p>

<p>
Contributors of accepted Abstracts will be invited to submit a Paper for the Conference Proceedings before 1 March 2008. All Papers submitted will be reviewed and the accepted Papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings, which will appear on CD-ROM.
</p -->

<p>
Full text draft papers (4–6 two-column pages) should be submitted by <b>November 15, 2007</b> to the Organizing Committee. All contri­butions will be subject to reviewing. No more than two papers for each presenting author will be accepted.
</p>

<p>
The title should be followed by the authors' names, affiliations, addresses (including FAX and E-mail address) and abstracts (60–100 words). Electronic submission in PDF or PS format is preferable. The site for electronic submission will be launched in <b>September, 2007</b>. Accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings, which will appear on CD-ROM and will be available for conference participants on the website after the meeting.
