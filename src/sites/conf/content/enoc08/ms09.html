<h2 align=center>Mini-Symposium on Experimental Methods</h2>

<p>
Papers are solicited in the general area of experimental nonlinear dynamics. Experimental investigations, nonlinear dynamical system approaches to data analysis and interpretation, and comparisons with analytical predictions are especially welcome.
<br>
In particular, contributions should address one of the following topics:
</p>


<ul>
<li>Novel experimental techniques to assess and enhance understanding of nonlinear dynamic behaviour;</li>
<li>Experimental results on the observation of new nonlinear dynamic phenomena;</li>
<li>Comparison of experimental results with theoretical predictions of nonlinear systems;</li>
<li>Identification of reduced-order models of nonlinear systems via experimental data;</li>
<li>Experimental verification of linear and nonlinear controller design strategies for nonlinear dynamic systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Applications in different fields, such as mechanics, electronics, acoustics or embedded systems, are of interest. Experimental systems may vary from laboratory setups to full-scale industrial applications.
</p>

<p>
Full text draft papers (4–6 two-column pages) should be submitted by <b>November 15, 2007</b> to the Organizing Committee. All contri­butions will be subject to reviewing. No more than two papers for each presenting author will be accepted.
</p>

<p>
The title should be followed by the authors' names, affiliations, addresses (including FAX and E-mail address) and abstracts (60–100 words). Electronic submission in PDF or PS format is preferable. The site for electronic submission will be launched in <b>September, 2007</b>. Accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings, which will appear on CD-ROM and will be available for conference participants on the website after the meeting.
</p>
