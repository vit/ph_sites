<h2 align=center>Mini-Symposium on Nonlinear Stochastic Systems</h2>

<p>
In the past decade, advances in nonlinear stochastic dynamics have been rapid with applications to almost all fields of engineering. Practical applications of fundamental results in these areas are beginning to appear across the entire spectrum of science. It has brought about an enormous increase in the number of scientists working in this area, and the discovery of many important new phenomena.
</p>

<p>
This mini-symposium will provide a forum for the discussion of developments in nonlinear and stochastic dynamics and review both fundamental theory and its applications in mechanics, physics, signal-processing, biology and other areas of science and technology. Papers are solicited in some of the relevant topics that are in the forefront of current development of nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. Subject areas include, but are not limited to:
<ol>
<li>Multi-scale phenomena in stochastic dynamics</li>
<li>Stability and bifurcations of stochastic systems</li>
<li>Control estimation of nonlinear stochastic systems</li>
<li>Computational methods in stochastic dynamics</li>
<li>Modeling and random vibrations</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Full text draft papers (4–6 two-column pages) should be submitted by <b>November 15, 2007</b> to the Organizing Committee. All contri­butions will be subject to reviewing. No more than two papers for each presenting author will be accepted.
</p>

<p>
The title should be followed by the authors' names, affiliations, addresses (including FAX and E-mail address) and abstracts (60–100 words). Electronic submission in PDF or PS format is preferable. The site for electronic submission will be launched in <b>September, 2007</b>. Accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings, which will appear on CD-ROM and will be available for conference participants on the website after the meeting.
</p>
