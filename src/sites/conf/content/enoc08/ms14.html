<h2 align=center>Mini-Symposium on Nonlinear Dynamics of Structures and Machines</h2>

<p>
The aim of the mini-symposium is to gather specialists from universities, research institutes and industry working on various engineering applications of nonlinear dynamics. The mini-symposium is expected to cover the following topics:
stationary and transient nonlinear dynamics of structures and machines, resonances in structures and machines, absorption of mechanical vibrations, nonlinear dynamics of plates, arches and shells, fluid-structure interaction, dynamics of rotating beams, dynamics of turbo machinery, dynamics of rotor systems, nonlinear dynamics of suspended cables, gear dynamics, vibrations with non-ideal energy sources, dynamics of composite structures, vehicle dynamics, drill columns dynamics, etc.
</p>
<p>
In addition, there will be an emphasis on resonance problems in structures, problems of distributed system digitization, localization and transfer of energy in mechanical systems, and modern analytical, computer and experimental studies in the engineering sciences.
</p>

<p>
Full text draft papers (4–6 two-column pages) should be submitted by <b>November 15, 2007</b> to the Organizing Committee. All contri­butions will be subject to reviewing. No more than two papers for each presenting author will be accepted.
</p>

<p>
The title should be followed by the authors' names, affiliations, addresses (including FAX and E-mail address) and abstracts (60–100 words). Electronic submission in PDF or PS format is preferable. The site for electronic submission will be launched in <b>September, 2007</b>. Accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings, which will appear on CD-ROM and will be available for conference participants on the website after the meeting.
</p>
