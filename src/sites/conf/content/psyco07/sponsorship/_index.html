IFAC Workshops ALCOSP 2007 and PSYCO 2007 Organizing Committee would like to offer tiered sponsorship opportunities and exhibit space for interested corporations. The opportunity for industry sponsorship is to access an assembled audience of industrialists, researchers, educators and students specialized in modeling, control, identification, learning and intelligent systems, filtering and signal processing. Other aspects are marketing, recruitment, and a window onto newly developing cutting edge techniques, technologies, and applications in the important areas of process applications, design, and management. 
</p>

<p>
Any sponsoring company may select a number of items listed below as a part of their sponsorship package. If you are interested in being a sponsor or exhibitor, please contact the Chair, Prof. Alexander Fradkov or the Exhibits Chair Prof. Boris Andrievsky at <a href="mailto:alcosp07@physcon.ru">alcosp07@physcon.ru</a>.
