To participate in the Conference one have to register by filling in the 
 Registration / Hotel reservation form and paying the registration fee.
 Registration / Hotel Reservation forms will be available
 by the date of  acceptance notification:  April 15, 2007.
 Some preliminary information can be found below.
 
<p>
 1.  HOTEL INFORMATION. One can make hotel reservation  directly
 with hotels or travel web-agencies (some links can be easily found
 on the web and will be provided  on the conference  website later).
 However, summer is a hot tourist season in Saint Petersburg and
 hotel prices in summer are rather high. We usually recommend 
 to make reservation through our partner  travel agency <a href="http://www.monomax.ru">Monomax</a>
 which provides rooms in a number of hotels conveniently located not far from the conference venue (Anichkov Palace) with 5%-10% discount for conference participants. Those who prefer booking the hotel before  notification of the paper  acceptance 
should contact organizers at <a href="mailto:psyco07@physcon.ru">psyco07@physcon.ru</a>
 
<p>
 2. VISA INFORMATION. Citizens of most countries need visa to come
 to Russia. In order to obtain entry visa one needs to submit an 
 application to the Russian consulate along with an official invitation 
 letter (VISA SUPPORT LETTER).  VISA SUPPORT LETTER FOR TOURIST VISA
 should be issued by the travel agency or the hotel. 
VISA SUPPORT LETTER FOR BUSINESS VISA should be issued by Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs by request of an inviting organization; in our case - Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS). Note 
 that Monomax company  provides VISA SUPPORT LETTER FOR TOURIST VISA
 very fast and  with no extra costs along with hotel reservation. 
 Just mention your personal data ( name, date and place of birth, 
 passport number and passport expiration date) in your hotel 
 reservation request.
 
<p>
        The  Organizers can provide you with VISA SUPPORT LETTER 
 FOR BUSINESS VISA issued by request of RAS.
 To make a request for the invitation, we must submit to Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs the filled form with your personal data
 and the copy of the main page(s) of your passport with your name, 
photo, date and place of birth, passport number and passport 
expiration date. Issuing VISA SUPPORT LETTER  costs some EUR  25-40, depending on the time of issuing (20-30 days).

 3. Please, make sure that your travel insurance is valid in Russia.
