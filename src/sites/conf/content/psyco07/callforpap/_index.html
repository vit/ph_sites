<p>
<b>SCOPE:</b>
<br>
A major goal of the Workshop is to bring together researchers and educators
 and to gain some general and unified perspectives in the studying of
 periodic systems. The scope of the workshop will cover all areas of
 periodic systems theory and applications, periodic control design, 
modeling and signal processing of periodic phenomena as well as all areas
 of applications to science and engineering. The topics for the Workshop 
PSYCO 2007 include but are not limited to: 
<ul>
<li>Periodic control analysis and design</li>
<li>Stability and instability of periodic systems</li>
<li>Learning and repetitive control</li>
<li>Discrete-time and sampled-data systems</li>
<li>Multi-rate and hybrid systems</li>
<li>Control of oscillations</li>
<li>Periodic time-series</li>
<li>Complex dynamics and control of time-varying systems and networks</li>
<li>Applications of periodic systems (motion control, communications, 
nano- and femto-technologies, etc.)</li>
</ul>
Panel discussion on topics of interest to industry is to be organized. 
Industrial companies are invited to participate in product exhibition 
(please contact the organizers).

<p>
<b>SOCIAL PROGRAM:</b>
<br>
Saint Petersburg (the former capital of Russia) with about 5 millions
inhabitants is often called "The Venice of the North" and recognized
as one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Various guided tours
over St. Petersburg and sub-urbs including visits to Tsars' palaces 
and museums will be organized during both the Workshop days and the weekends. 

<p>
<b>LOCATION AND CONFERENCE VENUE:</b>
<br>
St.Petersburg is located in the mouth of Neva river near the Finnish
Gulf of the Baltic Sea. There are daily flights of major international
carriers to the International airport "Pulkovo" of St.Petersburg.
It also can be reached from Helsinki, Finland by plane (0.5 hours)
or by train (4 hours).

<p>
The Workshop will take place in the Imperial Anichkov Palace - 
one of the residences of the Tsars' family in several generations, 
beautifully located in the historical center of the city. 
Some pictures of the Anichkov Palace can be found on the Workshop
