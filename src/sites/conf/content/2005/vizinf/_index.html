Russian rules, to obtain  visa one needs to submit an application to 
the Russian consulate along with an official invitation letter (VISA SUPPORT LETTER)
 issued by Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs by request of an inviting organization.

request of Russian Academy of Sciences. To make a request for the invitation, 
we must submit to Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs the filled form with your 
personal data and the copy of the page(s) of your passport with your name, photo,
date of birth, passport number and passport expiration date.
