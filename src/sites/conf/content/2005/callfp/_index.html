  <p class = paratitle align="center"><b>Dear Colleagues and Guests,</b> </p>
  
  
  <p>
  It is our honor and pleasure to invite you to participate in the
   International  Conference  "Physics and Control" (PhysCon 2005)
  to be held on August 24-26, 2005 in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
  
  
  
  <p>
     The Conference "Physics and Control 2005" will be the
  second international
  conference focusing on the borderland between Physics and
  Control with
  emphasis on both theory and applications. The first
   Conference
    "Physics and Control 2003" (St.Petersburg, 20-22 Aug.
  2003) was a success
  with about 250 participants from 33 countries.
  
  <p>
     A major goal of the Conference is to bring together
  researchers from
  different scientific communities and to gain some general
  and unified
  perspectives in the studying of controlled systems in
  physics, chemistry,
  biology and other natural sciences.
  
  
  
  
  <p>
  We will do our best to create a friendly atmosphere for work and rest, encourage new 
  personal contacts and exchange of ideas. We wish the participants 
  to enjoy the historical sites and the amenities of this city, 
  including the masterpieces of the Hermitage and the Russian Museum, 
  the Royal palaces, charming suburbs, picturesque islands and embankments. 
  Make your plans to stay over the weekend to attend various sightseeing tours
  <br>
  <br>
      The Symposium will be held in the beautiful
  <a href="http://album.physcon.ru/anichkov/" target=_blank>"Anichkov Palace"</a>, located in the historical part of the city,  one of the 
  residences of the Tsars' family in several generations.<br>
  
  <p>
     Looking  forward to meeting you in Saint Petersburg in August 2005.<br>
