  Dear Colleagues and Friends,
  The Second International Conference "Physics and Control" (PhysCon 2005) is now a part 
  of history. It was a success with 190 registered participants. 
  46 participants came from outside of Russia, including 9 from Japan, 6 from Germany,
  3 from China, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, 2 from France. 212 talks (6 plenary, 3 invited and 70 poster)
  of more than 250 submitted were included into the preliminary program. 
  They represent  35 countries. 184 papers are included into the CD-ROM Proceedings and will be 
  published in the IEEExplore Electronic Library.
  The Final Report and the Conference Photo Gallery will be posted soon.
  At the closing ceremony it was decided to organize the next 
  "Physics and Control" Conference in 2007, probably in Potsdam, Germany.
  
  <p>
  A remarkable event took place immediately after the closing: it was the Foundation meeting of the International Physics And Control Society (IPACS). At the meeting the IPACS Regulations developed by the  initiative group created at the closing of PhysCon 2003 were approved. More information will appear at the 
  <a href="http://www.physcon.ru">Physics and Control website</a> very soon.
  
  <p>
  Many thanks to all the participants for their coming!
