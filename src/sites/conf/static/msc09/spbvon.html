<p>
The city was always in the high road of Russian history - during two centuries it was the Capital 
of the Russian State. Now the city won a good name as a Culture Capital of Russia and plays an essential 
part in Russian scientific life. Saint Petersburg is a historical scientific center of Russia, where the
1st Russian University and Russian Academy of Sciences were founded 275 years ago. 
<br><br>
Saint Petersburg was founded by Russian Tsar 
<a href=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/history/peter1st.asp target="_blank"><font color="blue"> Peter the Great</font></a> 
(<b>Peter I</b>, <i>1689-1725 years of governing</i>) during the Northern War of Russia with Sweden. 
<b>May 16 1703</b> is seemed to be the date of Saint Petersburg foundation. 
The famous <a href=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/virtual-tour/peter-paul-fortress.asp target="_blank"><font color="blue"> Peter and Paul fortress </font></a> 

(see <a href=http://fortress.spb.osi.ru/>livecam image:</font></a> )

with the church in name <b> Saints Peter and Paul</b> was laid in the Zayachy Island on the delta of the Neva River. 
After a year, in 1704, the first Russian sea fortress <b>Kronstadt</b> was constructed in the Finish Gulf. 
In 1710 the Capital of Russia was transferred to Saint Petersburg from Moscow. 
In 1914, during the First World War, the city was renamed into 
<aa href=http://www.cityvision2000.com/history/petrograd.htm#Name change target="_blank"><ffont color="blue"> Petrograd</ffont></aa>. 
Because of the October Coup on November 1917 the political system in Russia was changed and 
the mess in economy followed this event. A lot of national treasures were sold out or destroyed. 
In 1924 Bolsheviks renamed the city into <b>Leningrad</b>. 
The name of Saint Peter was given back to the city in 1991. 
<a href=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/history/siege.asp target="_blank"><font color="blue"> The  Blokada</font></a> 
(the Siege) of Leningrad during the <b>Great Patriotic War</b> was the most tragic period for the city. 
It lasted from September 1941 till January 1944, about 900 days and nights. 
During the Blokada about a million of civilians died of hunger and were killed by bombs. 
The monuments of history and culture and the suburban palace complexes were ruined. 
<aa href=http://www.cityvision2000.com/history/postwar.htm target="_blank"><ffont color="blue"> The restoration </ffont></aa> 
works started right after the war and are continuing nowadays. Despite of the tragic ages of its history, 
Saint Petersburg was and remains one of the treasures of world art and architect. 
Upon the decision of UNESCO Saint Petersburg has been recognized as a Monument of the World's Culture.
