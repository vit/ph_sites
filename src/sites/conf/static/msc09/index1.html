<p>
The inaugural IEEE Multi-conference on Systems and Control (MSC), to be held at the Suntec City Convention Centre in Singapore from 1– 3 October 2007, officially brings together two international conferences with well established track records and long histories of success — the 16th IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA) and the 22nd IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control (ISIC) — for greater impact and scientific exchange. It provides the international community of researchers and practitioners a greater opportunity to discuss the latest advancements and future directions in the areas of intelligent systems and advanced control. The conference welcomes paper submissions from researchers, practitioners, and students, and will cover myriad topics in control applications, and control methods based on biological, learning, and embedded cooperative systems.
